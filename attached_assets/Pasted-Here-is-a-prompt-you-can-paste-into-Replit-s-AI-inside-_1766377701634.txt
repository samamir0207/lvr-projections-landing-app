Here is a prompt you can paste into Replit’s AI inside your projections Repl:

⸻

I need your help finishing an integration between this Repl and a Google Sheets Apps Script.

Context:
	1.	This Repl hosts a property projections landing page template for LocalVR.
	2.	We have a backend route POST /api/projections that should accept projection data for a single property, insert it into the template, and return URLs:
	•	publicUrl
	•	trackingUrl
	3.	From Google Sheets, an Apps Script builds a JSON payload and sends it to this endpoint.

Right now the POST is returning this error:

{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Invalid projection data",
  "details": {
    "fieldErrors": {
      "projections": ["Required","Required","Required"],
      "seasonality": ["Expected object, received array"]
    }
  }
}

This tells me my JSON shape does not match the ProjectionData type you expect.

What I need from you:
	1.	Find the single property data type that the landing page uses. I believe it is something like ProjectionData or similar in shared/localvrData.ts or a related file.
	2.	Show me the exact TypeScript type / interface / Zod schema for that data structure, especially the fields:
	•	projections
	•	monthlyRevenue
	•	seasonality
	3.	Tell me which fields are required vs optional, and what the expected shapes are. For example:
	•	What is the exact structure of projections?
(Keys, data types, and any nested objects.)
	•	What is the exact structure of monthlyRevenue?
Is it an array of 12 objects, a simple array of numbers, or an object with low and high arrays, etc?
	•	What is the exact structure of seasonality?
Is it an object like { seasons: Season[] } or something else? Which properties on each season are required?
	4.	Please also paste an example of a valid sample data object that the app currently uses to render a working landing page. This can be the default hard coded property data if you have it.

For reference, here is roughly what my Apps Script is sending right now (structure only, not exact values):

{
  "meta": {
    "slug": "221-carnelian-bay-cir",
    "homeownerFirstName": "Sam",
    "homeownerFullName": "Sam Amir",
    "leadId": "00QUb000004VHGn"
  },
  "property": {
    "address": "221 Carnelian Bay Cir",
    "city": "Inlet Beach",
    "state": "FL",
    "market": "30A",
    "bedrooms": 4,
    "bathrooms": 3,
    "squareFeet": 2500
  },
  "projections": {
    "lowAnnualRevenue": 58000,
    "expectedAnnualRevenue": 72000,
    "highAnnualRevenue": 87000,
    "disclaimer": "Long disclaimer text..."
  },
  "monthlyRevenue": [
    { "month": "Jan", "low": 4000, "high": 6000 },
    { "month": "Feb", "low": 4500, "high": 6500 }
    // ... through Dec
  ],
  "seasonality": {
    "seasons": [
      {
        "name": "Peak Days",
        "daysAvailable": 10,
        "daysBookedLow": 8,
        "daysBookedHigh": 10,
        "occLowPercent": 80,
        "occHighPercent": 100,
        "adrLow": 740,
        "adrHigh": 1109
      }
      // other seasons...
    ]
  },
  "cta": {
    "aeSlug": "kaci-wolkers",
    "aeName": "Kaci Wolkers",
    "aeTitle": "Account Executive",
    "aeEmail": "kaci.wolkers@golocalvr.com",
    "aePhone": "850-641-1001",
    "aeCalendarUrl": "https://calendar.google.com/..."
  }
}

The goal:
	•	Either adjust my payload shape to match your expected schema, or, if needed, slightly relax the backend validation to accept this shape.
	•	Then confirm what the payload should look like so I can update my Apps Script.

Please:
	1.	Identify the correct type used for request validation for POST /api/projections.
	2.	Show the exact type / schema and a working example.
	3.	Tell me precisely what I need to change in my JSON for projections, monthlyRevenue, and seasonality so that validation passes.

Use that with Replit, then paste back whatever schema or sample object it gives you and I can rewrite the Apps Script payload to match it exactly.
