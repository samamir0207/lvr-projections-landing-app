Goal  
Turn my current 174 Grande Pointe landing page into a reusable “ProjectionPage” template that is driven 100% by JSON data, not hardcoded address, market, or numbers.

Context  
The repo has:

- data.json (root) with all the projection data
- client/src/main.tsx
- client/src/App.tsx
- client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx
- client/src/components/HeroSection.tsx
- client/src/components/ProjectionSummary.tsx
- client/src/components/MonthlyRevenueChart.tsx
- client/src/components/SeasonalityTable.tsx
- server/storage.ts
- shared/schema.ts
- shared/localvrData.ts (if present)

Right now all the copy and numbers are specific to 174 Grande Pointe in 30A. I want that page to stay the same visually, but I want the code to become a generic template that can render any property whose data is in JSON.

Step 1: Update data.json schema for template use

1) Add a meta block for personalization and slug:

"meta": {
  "slug": "174-grande-pointe-cir-rosemary-beach-fl",
  "homeownerFirstName": "Allison",
  "homeownerFullName": "Allison Smith"
}

2) Keep the existing property, projections, seasonality, monthlyRevenue, trust, and cta blocks as they are now. Do NOT hardcode 174-specific text anywhere in the components. All dynamic content should come from this JSON.

3) Ensure cta contains AE info:

"cta": {
  "scheduleCallUrl": "...",
  "aeName": "...",
  "aeTitle": "...",
  "aePhone": "...",
  "aeEmail": "...",
  "aeHeadshotUrl": "..."
}

Step 2: Define a ProjectionData type and central loader

1) In shared/schema.ts, define a ProjectionData interface that matches data.json, including:

- meta: { slug, homeownerFirstName, homeownerFullName }
- property: { address, city, state, market, bedrooms, bathrooms, squareFeet, etc. }
- projections: { expectedAnnualRevenue, lowAnnualRevenue, highAnnualRevenue, disclaimer }
- monthlyRevenue: whatever structure data.json uses now
- seasonality: whatever structure data.json uses now
- trust: stats and pillars
- cta: AE info as above

2) In shared/localvrData.ts (or create this file if it does not exist):

- Import the JSON for 174 as sample data.
- Export a function like:

export function getProjectionBySlug(slug: string): ProjectionData | null {
  // For now, only support 174 by matching meta.slug.
  // Later I will add more properties.
}

For now, hardcode the mapping: if slug equals the meta.slug, return the imported data.

Step 3: Refactor the React side into a template

1) Create a ProjectionPage component that takes a single prop:

type ProjectionPageProps = { data: ProjectionData };

function ProjectionPage({ data }: ProjectionPageProps) {
  // Use data.meta, data.property, data.projections, data.monthlyRevenue,
  // data.seasonality, data.trust, and data.cta to render the whole page.
}

2) Update the existing components to consume data instead of hardcoded strings:

- HeroSection.tsx:
  - Accept props like { data: ProjectionData } or a narrower subset.
  - Use data.meta.homeownerFirstName for the headline, for example:
    "{homeownerFirstName}, Your Custom Rental Projections Are Ready"
  - Use data.cta fields for AE name, title, email, phone, headshot, and Calendly link.
  - Use data.property for the property snapshot (BR, BA, sq ft, city, market).

- ProjectionSummary.tsx:
  - Use data.projections.lowAnnualRevenue, expectedAnnualRevenue, and highAnnualRevenue.
  - Do not hardcode any specific dollar values.

- MonthlyRevenueChart.tsx:
  - Use data.monthlyRevenue only.
  - Remove any hardcoded month values or amounts.
  - The chart should iterate over whatever shape monthlyRevenue has in data.json.

- SeasonalityTable.tsx:
  - Use data.seasonality only.
  - Remove any hardcoded season names, ranges, or ADRs.
  - The table should iterate the seasonality structure in data.json.

3) LandingPage.tsx should now be a thin wrapper:

- It receives a ProjectionData object (from props or a hook) and passes it down to ProjectionPage.
- For now, import the 174 data directly and call <ProjectionPage data={projectionData} />.

4) App.tsx and main.tsx:

- Make sure the app renders the LandingPage with the sample data for now.
- Later I will wire in routing by slug and server-side loading; for this pass, the main requirement is that nothing is hardcoded and all dynamic values come from ProjectionData.

Step 4: Clean up hardcoded 174 references

Search the entire client codebase for:

- "174 Grande"
- "Grande Pointe"
- "Inlet Beach"
- "Allison"
- Any of the specific projection numbers

Remove all of these literals from TSX files. They should only appear inside data.json. The components must read from the ProjectionData prop instead.

End result

- data.json holds example data for 174.
- shared/schema.ts defines ProjectionData.
- shared/localvrData.ts can return ProjectionData by slug (for now only 174).
- ProjectionPage is a pure template: it gets data: ProjectionData and renders the page.
- HeroSection, ProjectionSummary, MonthlyRevenueChart, and SeasonalityTable read only from data props, never from hardcoded strings.

Please implement these changes and show me the updated ProjectionData interface and the ProjectionPage component so I can verify everything is template-driven.
